{"name":"Ractive-widgets-virtual-scroll","tagline":"Virtual scroll implementation for RactiveJS (For Dynamic height and equal height lists)","body":"This is a Virtual Scroll widget for RactiveJS inspired by Rich Harris's (Creator of RactiveJS) infinite scroll plugin. It excels at large data rendering in Mobiles or Desktop browsers.\r\n\r\n### How to embed\r\n```\r\n<!-- Father of all below files ;) -->\r\n<script src=\"lib/ractive.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<!-- Viewport event for Ractive, required for this widget -->\r\n<script src=\"lib/in-view.js\"></script> [Check it here](https://github.com/svapreddy/ractive-event-viewport)\r\n\r\n<!-- Virtual Scroll Widget -->\r\n<script src=\"lib/ractive-widgets-vscroll.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n\r\nWill add user suggested features.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Possibilities\r\n\r\nWith the current version, you can display a data grid (Check demo.html) and can be used to make a chat box and many. This is a better alternative for jQuery's Data table or slickGrid etc.., but it does not provide straight forward methods as they provide. Moving forward, will add more features based on users suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n```\r\n<vScroll list='{{data}}' formatter='listItem' blockCount='100' reverse='true' />\r\n```\r\n\r\n**_list_**\r\n\r\nData you want to pass to the widget. Data synced with Ractive instance's data. Should be flat array of any type of data.\r\nFor example :  `[1,2,3,........100000]` or `[{a:1, b : 2}...... ]` will work\r\n\r\n**_formatter_**\r\n\r\nformatter you want to apply to render each list item. It should be id of the script tag (without #).\r\nFor example, if you have a script tag with id \"listItem\" then you should pass the same id. Do not append any `#`\r\n\r\n**_blockCount_** \r\n\r\nCheck \"Idea behind it\" section to understand this.\r\n\r\n**_reverse_**\r\n\r\nWhether you want to display list from bottom to top or regular. Bottom to top works as Mobiles MessageBox. Please check demo page to understand how it works.\r\n\r\n### Idea behind it\r\n\r\nWhen you pass data and blockCount(`default:50`), data's indexes will be spliced into block. For example if you pass data as `[11,22,31,43]` and blockCount as 2 then it will be spliced as [0,1], [2,3]. Upon data update splices will be updated accordingly. It follows a simple philosophy, when an block of data is on viewport display data inside, else remove inside data and by setting fake height to the element, so user will not know data is removed, but when it comes back into viewport the data for the block will be re rendered. In this way it keeps DOM minimal.\r\n\r\n### Demo?\r\nPlease clone repo, and open demo.html in any web browser. That's it. Demo.html contains two virtual scroll elements.\r\n\r\n### Browsers\r\nIt should work in every browser (Browsers that actually support Internet). But tested in Chrome, Mozilla and IE. Someone please test it in IE and file an issue if any.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nPrathap Reddy SV, svap.reddy(at)hotmail(dot)com.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nDo whatever you want to do with it.
